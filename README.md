# Analyzing NFL Data!

Hello! I've been working on publicizing helper code and data for nflscrapR, hopefully making it easier to use. My name is Lee Sharpe, and you can find me on Twitter at [@LeeSharpeNFL](https://twitter.com/LeeSharpeNFL). Feel free to reach out if you have questions!

I want to credit for inspiration and some of the code: [Ben Baldwin](http://twitter.com/benbbaldwin) for his [excellent nflscrapR tutorial](https://gist.github.com/guga31bb/5634562c5a2a7b1e9961ac9b6c568701), as well as of course [Ron Yurko](http://twitter.com/ronyurko) and all of the other folks behind [nflscrapR](http://twitter.com/nflscrapR).

If you are brand new to R, data analysis, and programming generally, I wrote a simple tutorial off some other data that will likely be less intimidating for many than the huge nflscrapR data set. **[Start here](https://github.com/leesharpe/nfldata/blob/master/STANDINGS-GAMES.md) if that applies to you.**
